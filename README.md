<ol type="a">
<li> Take screenshots of sample documents with the anomaly before it is corrected.</li>
<li> Show the query/queries used to address this anomaly.</li>
<li> Take screenshots of samples of documents after the anomaly has been corrected.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol>
2. Create a new field publication_date in the format YYYY-MM-DD that merges publication_day, publication_month, and publication_year <b>[2 marks]</b>
</ol>
<ol>
3. Create another field in the books collection unix_publication_date that converts

</ol>

Write the following queries (Q1 to Q4) against the collections that you personalised and loaded youâ€™re

results as a screenshot showing the command and the documents returned. 

<ol>

<li> Find top 3 books with highest average rating above 3.5 and are not e-books. Display only book id, title, 
price, and average rating. <b>[5 marks]</b></li> 

<li> Who is the most famous reviewer in your dataset? Most famous reviewer have the highest number

</ol>



6.0 IMPLEMENT AND EXPLAIN INDEX FOR THE DATABASE <b>[15 marks]</b>

 1. Identify the chosen query from Section 5 and explain/justify your choice of index. Why do you think
 indexing could improve the query. <b>[5 marks]</b>

 2. Implement one index that would improve the querying of the database based on one of the queries
 (Q1-Q4). <b>[2 marks]</b>

 3. Present the execution plan of the selected query before the index and after the index has been
 created. Compare and discuss the execution plans to support your choice and summarise your
 findings. <b>[8 marks]</b>

7.0 RE-DESIGN THE DATABASE USING AGGREGATE DATA MODELLING <b>[20 marks]</b>

 1. Make new copy of the pxxxxxx_books collection and name it pxxxxxx_books_adm. <b>[1 mark]</b>
