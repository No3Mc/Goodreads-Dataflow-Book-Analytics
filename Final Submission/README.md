**2.0 SCENARIO**

Goodreads is an American social cataloguing website and a subsidiary of Amazon that allows individuals to search its database of books, annotations, quotes, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogues and reading lists. They can also create their own groups of book suggestions, surveys, polls, blogs, and discussions (copied directly from the Wikipedia page).
- Goodreads has a web page for each book e.g. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5333265
- or each review e.g., https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2410025795

A subset of Goodreads data has been selected for this coursework. There is data on books, reviews, authors, and genre. Permission was granted to use the data for this coursework from https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home on condition that the authorsâ€™ research papers are referenced (Mengting W. and Julian J. M 2018), (Mengting W et al. 2019). It is not necessary to read these papers to complete this coursework.

If you are having difficulties with the credentials above, paste the below URI in the Connection String window

mongodb://cwuser:cwuser@mongodb.dmu.ac.uk/?authMechanism=DEFAULT&authSource=IMAT3104Coursework

Note: At the moment, you can only connect to the MongoDB server while on university network. This means either you are on the University lab machines or you connect via Horizon. If you wish to work on your PC, you have to complete the ETL using above methods then move to your PC and import the personalized datasets.
